I would like to create a game focused on having students practice the concept of balancing redox reactions.  In the past, I have found this to be one of the least engaging chemical concepts which is presented in the general chemistry curriculum.  In addition, most types of assessment of this topic or opportunities for practice simply ask students to “balance a reaction” and compare their answers with the correct answers.

I believe creating a game revolving around this concept will keep students engaged and present them with a different way of demonstrating mastery over a chemical concept.

Name: Be balanced!

Concept: The main idea is to help students navigate and understand the necessary steps for balancing redox reactions in acidic or basic environments.

Audience: Undergraduate students enrolled in a general chemistry course.

Learning Objectives

Balance redox reactions using the half-reaction method
Balance redox reactions in acidic and basic conditions
Genre: "Strategy?"

A new chemical element is discovered and is found to react with known substances on Earth.  One of these reactions is particularly useful because it creates a compound which is similar to graphene: extremely lightweight, flexible, strong, hard, and resistant, among others!  The reaction is classified as a redox (oxidation-reduction reaction.)  While some of the reactants and products are known, no one has yet fully determined the balanced chemical reaction.  As a member of a research team, you are tasked with using the available information to determine the balanced chemical reaction which yields this useful substance.
End Goal: Completion of the game will indicate students understand the chemical concepts related to balancing redox reactions, as the correct answers are unlikely to be obtained by guessing.
